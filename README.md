# Project Codewars - Data structures

## Story

In this project, the goal is to challenge your knowledge in using data structures on Codewars.

> In this project, we ask you to solve these exercises on Codewars, but insert your solution here.
>
> By inserting your solution, you can easily check your peers' solution on reviews, by running *tests*.
>
> Speaking about tests! You can find a *class* named like *Test<kata-name>* and some other seemingly odd and new code snippets.
> These are ONLY there to help you check your solution, you don't need to worry about them!

## What are you going to learn?

- Use data structures (lists, dictionary, etc.).
- Solve algorithmic challenges.

## Tasks

1. Train on the challenge [My Language](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b16490986b6d336c900007d) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `my-language.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

2. Train on the challenge [My head is at the wrong end!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f699cd9400f5b7d8000b55) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `fix-the-meerkat.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

3. Train on the challenge [Nth smallest element](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a512f6a80eba857280000fc) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `n-th-smallest.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

4. Train on the challenge [Maximum Multiple](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5aba780a6a176b029800041c) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `maximum-multiple.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

5. Train on the challenge [Thinkful-List Drills - Longest word](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58670300f04e7449290000e5) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `longest.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You can test your solution of the `My Language` kata after inserting your solution in `my-language.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest my-language.TestMyLanguage.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `My head is at the wrong end!` kata after inserting your solution in `fix-the-meerkat.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest fix-the-meerkat.TestFixTheMeerkat.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Nth smallest element` kata after inserting your solution in `n-th-smallest.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest n-th-smallest.TestNthSmallest.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Maximum Multiple` kata after inserting your solution in `maximum-multiple.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest maximum-multiple.TestMaximumMultiple.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Thinkful-List Drills - Longest word` kata after inserting your solution in `longest.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest longest.TestLongest.test_basics`
